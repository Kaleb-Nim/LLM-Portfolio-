# Oct 12 todo for this repo 

- [x] Try and link FAST API vercel endpoint and send the chat to the endpoint
- [ ] Pinecone Upsert based on namespace instead of metadata categories 
- [ ] Pinecone query documents down
- [x] Plan out, workflow
- [ ] LLM Agent customization to be the main decision maker 
- [ ] Collate all my portfolio stuff
- [ ] Ingest Resume pdf and other documents that allows for ability to be cited
- [ ] Template components for LLM Agent to display text information ( React-Markdown )


## Future Ideas
- [ ] hybrid search with sparse-dense vectors ( Can be used to optimize search results for a given query )


## Problems 
- [ ] The "score" for similarity when querying from pinecone is not working very well, always gives a score 0.7-0.8 for all the queries no matter what.
* Could look into changing the metrics/embedding model to something else
